Simple bot making use of the Datamall LTA Bus timing API, along with pyTelegramBotAPI

Using python shelve module for persistent storage, small scale use. 

Able to track different bus stops for different users and only the bus services the user requests. 

Everything is written, commited and pushed from Termux on my Android tablet using nvim :)
